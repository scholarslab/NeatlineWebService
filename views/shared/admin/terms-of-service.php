            <h2>Purpose and Scope of this Site</h2>
            <p>This site has been created under the ownership and control of the University of Virginia Library to lower the technical bar necessary to evaluate the Neatline Omeka plugin created by the Scholars' Lab. Its purpose is to provide a short-term evaluation sandbox in which users can explore some features of the Neatline tool, and share their experiments with others. No submitted exhibits will be reviewed before being published online, but the Scholars' Lab does reserve the right to request revisions or remove any given exhibit. In other words, the Scholars' Lab Neatline Sandbox has been established to allow experimentation with the Neatline Omeka plugin, and does not constitute a forum for general expression.</p>
